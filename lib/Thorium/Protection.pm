=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Thorium::Protection;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This pragma[1] does:

=over

=item * Turns on strict

=item * Turns on all warnings

=item * Enable 5.10+ features via L<feature>

=item * Sets the method order resolution (mro) to C3. See L<mro> for more info

=item * Turns indirect method calling into a fatal action. This is done through
L<indirect>

=back

Inspiration derived from L<Modern::Perl> and cron.

[1] Technically not a pragma, but a lower case package name. But since we are
changing pragma-y things, make it look like one

=head1 WARNINGS

=over

=item * The C<use> should be as close to the first thing executed as possible,
otherwise you may think you have strict turned on, but won't.

=item * Use of this in modules isn't encouraged as you don't really gain
anything other than a shaving off a few keystrokes. Modules are generally not
invoked as if executables from the command line. Additionally there would be a
slight (not timed/tested) overhead of doing this a large amount of
times. Therefore, stick to use in non-modules.

=item * Not tested under mod_perl. While I don't suspect any problems, mod_perl
does weird things.

=item * This doesn't enabled strict, warnings, etc for all modules/other perl
associated with that script -- only to the end of the file.
